Exemple for NZ bathy code, that will be put at git@github.com:metocean/msl_tools/dataIO_tools/

Clone a repository to your computer:
at /source:
git clone git@github.com:metocean/msl_tools.git

Then I moved grd2nc_bathy.py to /source/msl_tools/dataIO_tools/
It should indicate there is a change to be commited (gst)

---------------------------------------------------------------------???
See the current configured remote repository for your fork:
git remote -v

To add the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork:
git remote add upstream git@github.com:metocean/sandbox.git

To verify it:
git remote -v
---------------------------------------------------------------------???

See status, if there is anything to commit:
gst or git status

Add:
git add grd2nc_bathy.py or git add * if you want to commit everything/many things were changed

Commit (do git gst before to check):
git commit -am "add script to convert grd files to nc including nc global attrs"

Push:
git pull --rebase  origin master (better to always do this one, to not have merge conflits)
git push origin master

Then I created a link to this file in my home:
at /home/juliana/bathy/bathy2netcdf  ln -s /source/msl_tools/dataIO_tools/grd2nc_bathy.py

!!! never have 2 copies of the same file in different places. Always ONE!

*** Always start a repository manually at github website, and always create the README. 
Then you clone it at you computer and do the steps above.
